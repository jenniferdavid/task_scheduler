Container terminal operations and decision problems can be grouped in four main classes.

Containers are usually transferred from the quayside to the yard, from
the yard to the gate and viceversa by internal trucks, straddle carriers and AGVs. The transfer
originates decision problems such as vehicle routing and dispatching strategies. Typical objec-
tives aim to minimize the vehicle fleet size, the total distance traveled to complete the tasks,
the fleet operating costs or the total operations delay. Some optimization strategies can also
include deadlock prevention and real-time conflict avoidance for automated guided vehicles
