#Lines after '#' is commented
#This is an example file showing rules of specifying an assignment
#The utility should be as below:
 32.20 20.12 25.22   # allow float and negative
 22.80 28.59 20.49   # non-num "abc" is converted to 0
 23.43 21.09 26.80 

# matrix could be square matrix, i.e.,  n X n, 
#if not square matrix, i.e., m X n, then it must be m <= n, i.e., row size <= column size
