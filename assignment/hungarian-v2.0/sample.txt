The assignment problem (matrix) you queried is:

  87	  61	  0	
  65	  80	  79	
  0	  3	  0	

The initial labels for vertices:
Labels for agents:
87 80 3 
Labels for tasks:
0 0 0 

Pick an unmatched agent: 0
No need relabel, pick available task(s) 0 and put in queue.
Got task VID 0
Task VID 0 has NOT been matched, then 0-->0 is an augmenting path, searching...
I am AGENT VID: 0
--Found target TASK VID: 0, augmenting path found!
Display augmenting path: 
(0,0) 

Pick an unmatched agent: 1
No need relabel, pick available task(s) 1 and put in queue.
Got task VID 1
Task VID 1 has NOT been matched, then 1-->1 is an augmenting path, searching...
I am AGENT VID: 1
--Found target TASK VID: 1, augmenting path found!
Display augmenting path: 
(1,1) 

Pick an unmatched agent: 2
No need relabel, pick available task(s) 1 and put in queue.
Got task VID 1
Task VID 1 has been matched, and I gonna extend alternating tree.
Extending alternating tree...
Need relabel. Searching for min_delta...
(1,0)->min_data: 15
(1,2)->min_data: 1
No need relabel, pick available task(s) 2 and put in queue.
Got task VID 2
Task VID 2 has NOT been matched, then 2-->2 is an augmenting path, searching...
I am AGENT VID: 2
--Found matched TASK VID: 1
I am TASK VID: 1
--Found matched AGENT VID: 1
I am AGENT VID: 1
--Found target TASK VID: 2, augmenting path found!
Display augmenting path: 
(2,1) (1,1) (1,2)
