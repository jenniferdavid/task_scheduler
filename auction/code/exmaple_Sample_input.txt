Suppose that file items.dat contains:

2
5.00 05:06:27 Chinese Vase
25.00 15:30:11 Hummel Figurine    

and that file bidders.dat contains:

2
jjones 37.37
ssmith 55.55    

and that file bids.dat contains:

3
jjones 26.00 00:18:03 Hummel Figurine
jjones 60.00 04:03:01 Chinese Vase
ssmith 27.00 09:03:05 Chinese Vase    


Then if the program is invoked like this

program-name items.dat bidders.dat bids.dat

the output should be

Chinese Vase reserve not met
Hummel Figurine won by jjones for 26.00
